# Gravity Swap üéØ

### Project Description
A twist on the classic Flappy Bird game where gravity changes every 6 seconds.
Players start by preventing the bird from falling, then must suddenly adapt to stop it from flying upwards.
This constant reversal forces quick reflexes and adaptability, making it far more chaotic and fun.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The original Flappy Bird is simple and predictable, making it easy for players to get used to its mechanics.
We wanted to introduce an extra challenge that disrupts rhythm and keeps players on edge.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a gameplay mechanic where gravity reverses periodically, forcing players to continuously relearn movement patterns.
This unpredictability increases difficulty and adds a unique twist for both casual and competitive play.
