### Project Description
A twist on the classic Flappy Bird game where gravity changes every 6 seconds.
Players start by preventing the bird from falling, then must suddenly adapt to stop it from flying upwards.
This constant reversal forces quick reflexes and adaptability, making it far more chaotic and fun.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The original Flappy Bird is simple and predictable, making it easy for players to get used to its mechanics.
We wanted to introduce an extra challenge that disrupts rhythm and keeps players on edge.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a gameplay mechanic where gravity reverses periodically, forcing players to continuously relearn movement patterns.
This unpredictability increases difficulty and adds a unique twist for both casual and competitive play.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used-
   1.HTML5-Structuring the web pages (`<video>`, `<canvas>`, `<audio>`, buttons, images, etc.)
   2.CSS-Styling animations, layout, buttons, fonts, background effects                    
   3.JavaScript-Main logic for animations, interactivity, canvas drawing, gravity flip mechanics  
- Frameworks used-There are no JavaScript frameworks used in this project. The project is built using pure JavaScript.
- Libraries used-
    1.Google Fonts(Orbitron, PressStart2P)-Custom sci-fi and retro game fonts
    2.Web APIs (built-in)	
- Tools used-
    1.HTML5-Used for drawing and animating the flappy bird‚Äìstyle game                               
    2.CSS Keyframes-Used to animate logo scaling, stars, button pulses, etc.
